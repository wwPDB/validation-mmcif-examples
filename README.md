Examples of wwPDB validation reports in mmCIF format

The following directories contain examples of the wwPDB validation reports written in mmCIF format.

They comply to the dictionary found at the [mmcif dictionary site](https://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_pdbx_vrpt.dic/Index/).

There are examples for different experimental types, include X-ray, NMR, Electron Microscopy and Electron Crystallography.

Some examples:

* [1CBS](examples/1cbs_validation.cif), a 1.8Å resolution X-ray structure of a small protein and a ligand, an entry with better overall quality relative to all X-ray structures.
* [1FCC](examples/1fcc_validation.cif), a 3.2Å resolution structure with worse overall quality relative to all X-ray structures.
* [1EG1](examples/1eg1_validation.cif), a 3.6Å resolution structure with possible ligand geometry and fit to density issues.
* [7JIA](examples/7jia_validation.cif), a solution NMR entry with restraints analysis.
* [6QWR](examples/6qwr_validation.cif), a solid-state NMR entry.
* [EMD-4960](examples/emd-4960_validation.cif), a 3.9Å resolution EM map including ligand, FSC curve and half-maps.
* [EMD-21212](examples/emd-21212_validation.cif)/[6VJA](examples/6vja_validation.cif), a 3.30Å single particle EM reconstruction with model including FSC curve, half-maps and mask.
* [EMD-0509](examples/emd-0509_validation.cif), analysis of an EM tomogram.
